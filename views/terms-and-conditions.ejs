        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p>Welcome to SafeReturns. Please read our terms and conditions carefully.</p>

        <h3>Accuracy of Results</h3>
        <p>This application uses advanced face recognition technology based on a model that provides approximately 93% accuracy. However, it is important to understand that this system does not guarantee 100% accuracy in identifying individuals.</p>
        <p>Various factors such as lighting conditions, age differences, facial expressions, and the quality of uploaded images can affect the accuracy of face matching. Therefore, the matches provided should be viewed as potential leads, not definitive confirmations of identity.</p>

        <h3>No Guarantee of Match</h3>
        <p>This application is designed to assist in locating missing persons by providing face recognition matching, but it cannot ensure a successful match in every case. The success of the system is dependent on the quality and availability of data provided by users (such as police stations, NGOs, and individuals).</p>
        <p>Matches provided should be independently verified by users through relevant authorities or other means before taking any further action.</p>

        <h3>User Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>Users are responsible for uploading clear and accurate images and providing correct information to ensure the best possible match results.</p>
        <p>The application should be considered a support tool in the process of finding missing persons, and professional assistance from authorities should always be sought in critical cases.</p>

        <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>The developers and operators of this application will not be liable for incorrect matches or missed matches due to the limitations of the technology.</p>
        <p>This tool is intended to assist in the search for missing persons, but it should not replace a thorough investigation by authorities.</p>

        <h3>Use of Data</h3>
        <p>All data provided by users, including personal information and photographs, will be stored securely and used solely for the purpose of identifying missing persons.</p>
        <p>Users are responsible for ensuring they have the necessary permissions to upload this information, and the application complies with strict privacy and security protocols.</p>

        <h3>Modifications and Updates</h3>
        <p>The developers reserve the right to modify or update the application and its terms and conditions at any time. Users will be notified of any significant changes that affect the application's functionality or usage.</p>
